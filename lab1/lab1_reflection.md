Lab 1 Reflection

Working on this lab gave me my first real experience programming in Python. I really liked Python’s clean and simple syntax — it’s easier to read and write than C/C++ because I didn’t have to declare variable types or worry about semicolons. Loops and conditionals felt straightforward, and functions are easy to define and call.

One thing that behaved differently than I expected was Python’s dynamic typing. For example, I could pass strings or numbers around without declaring types, which is flexible but also requires attention to avoid type errors. Another small surprise was how string comparison is case-sensitive by default, so I had to use .lower() to make the rock-paper-scissors function work correctly.

Compared to C/C++, Python lets me focus more on logic than syntax. I didn’t have to write boilerplate code like headers, main functions, or include statements. Memory management is automatic, which makes coding faster. However, Python runs slower than C/C++ and requires me to be mindful of large loops or recursion limits. Overall, Python is simpler and faster for writing small programs, but understanding performance considerations is still important.

This lab also helped me see how object-oriented programming works in Python. Creating UpCounter and DownCounter classes was easy, and inheritance worked smoothly. I can see how this compares to class definitions in C++ but with much less code.
